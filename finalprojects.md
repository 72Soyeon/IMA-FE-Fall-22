## Final Projects

You are now equipped with the basics of web development, allowing you to build fully functioning, interactive and/or reactive websites. 

Your final project should be a complete, fully-responsive, well designed website that will utilize HTML, CSS, Javascript (or optional Jquery), and interact with data from an API

Your project will be considered complete if you have completed the following:

    1) A wireframe
    2) A site map
    3) A moodboard
    4) A website, hosted on Github, that interacts with at least one API

* NOTE: Projects must be pushed to Github/Github Pages. They must be submitted via a link in NYU Classes alongside your Presentation Materials (moodboard, wireframe, sitemap) by May 5, regardless of the day you are scheduled to present.

Final Presentations: Think of this like a pitch for your idea. In your presentation, you should a) tell us what you made and WHY it was necessary you make it, b) demo your website, c) highlight key features in your code. You should show any supporting materials necessary to tell a story about why this site needed to be built.
