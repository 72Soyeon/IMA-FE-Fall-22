## Async Election Day

* As we discussed on Thursday, we're going to have class asynchronous today to give everyone time to vote and because some of us may have a hard time concentrating today
First and foremost, if you are able to vote in this country, PLEASE do so!

* Once you voted or encouraged someone else to vote, enjoy this fun app the NYT put together: [Election Stress Relief](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/10/30/style/election-stress-relief.html)

* Check out [Geoguesser](https://www.geoguessr.com/) (you could totally make this in this course)

* Code along with [Build a Meditation App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMBXdZzYqEk)
  * Assets are available [here](https://github.com/developedbyed/meditation-app/archive/master.zip)

* See you on Thursday for Zoom class!
