  ## Homework
  In [The Javascript Way](https://github.com/thejsway/thejsway)
    * Review Chapters 13 - 16 (no need to turn in the assignments but you should attempt them anyway)
    * Coding exercise:
      * Begin by creating an HTML document that has at least 10 of the same HTML elements.
      * Wrap some of these inside of `<div>` tags. Assign an ID to at least two of your `<div>` tags.
      * Build three buttons that will run a function on click.
      * Add three empty divs to the bottom of your page with unique IDs.
      * Now, create at least three functions that will run on click:
        * How many of the same HTML elements are on the page. (For example, if you included 10 `<p>`  tags, it should return a statement that says something like, "There are 10 paragraph tags on this page.")
        * How many elements are inside of your first ID
        * How many elements are inside of your second ID
        * Each function should update one of the three empty divs with this information
    * Submit a link to your GITHUB Repo for this code on NYU classes by the start of our next class Thursday, 10/29.
