* *In class assignment:*
Join Glitch and remix our [Restaurant Assignment](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/ima-fe-restaurant-assignment?path=index.html%3A1%3A0)
Add HTML to the Glitch that includes:
  * A DOCTYPE tag
  * An html tag
  * A head
    * Include a title and meta tag for the viewport
  * A body
  * In the body, add a large heading that acts as a headline that declares your favorite restaurant
  * Below this large heading, add a smaller sub-heading that tells the user a bold statement about this restaurant
  * Include *sensational* paragraph text that tells a fictional 3-4 sentence story about this restaurant.
  * Add a ridiculous image of a food item that this restaurant sells. Note, you will either need to find an image on the internet and link to its url or upload it to the Glitch roject.
  * Somewhere on the page, include a link to an external website. Make sure that link opens in a new tab or window. Bonus: Embed that link in the image.

*Download* a code editor of your choice (Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets.io, etc)

*Assignment*: Using [this as an example](https://codepen.io/callihiggins/pen/jOEjrPQ), add a Nav bar to your page that makes sense with the context of your restuarant's page. At the moment, it will just look like a bulleted list- thats ok! We'll make it look like a nav bar next week with css. Turn in the link to your Glitch via NYU Classes.

Have you done an intro to HTML learning log yet? If not, now is a great time to get your feet wet with basic tags. The [day1 folder](https://github.com/IDMNYU/DM-UY-2193-B/tree/master/01_jan29_day1) has some suggestions, but feel free to find your own.
