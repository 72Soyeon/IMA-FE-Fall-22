    * A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is not enough of a reason.
    * A wirefame of your home page
    * A mood board of images, inspirations, color palette, etc. that demonstrate the look and feel
    * A basic sitemap
