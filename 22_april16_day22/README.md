## Final Project Presentation

* Start by adding the PDF of your presentation to the final presentation channel in Slack
* For each person who presents, one other person will be in charge of taking notes of the feedback
* Add the feedback as a comment (or several) to the PDF
* Keep presentations/conversations under 15 minutes

## Homework

* Browse the other PDFs that you didn't get to see in your own group. Add any comments you have to the chain!
* Finish your NYTimes API assignment for Tuesday.
* Start working on your final! If you know what API you want to use, try pinging it in an ajax call! (If you are using a CMS, stay tuned for Tuesday's class)
