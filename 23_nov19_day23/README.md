## Final Project Presentation

* Start by adding the PDF of your presentation to the final presentation channel in Discord
* For each person who presents, one other person will be in charge of taking notes of the feedback
* Add the feedback as a comment (or several) to the PDF in Discord
* If you think of feedback for someone else, add it as a comment to their PDF in Discord

## Homework

* Browse the other PDFs that you didn't get to see in your own group. Add any comments you have to the chain!
* Keep working on your final! Aim to have worked through your data fetching by next Tuesday so you can concentrate on building out the whole experience.
