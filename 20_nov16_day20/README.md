## In class Exercise

Work with a partner to do the following:

  * Sign up for a [NYT API Key](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) (make sure both of you do this)
  * Pick a [NYT API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) you'd like to work with
  * Decide what you want to search for in this API. Give your page a heading and a description of the data being displayed.
  * Use Fetch to get data that populates your html
  * Give that HTML some CSS
  * Make sure you both leave class with a copy of your code. If you didn't finish, complete the assignment for homework (feel free to finish it on your own or continue to work together).
  * Each of you should upload to Brightspace via a Github link.

## Homework

  * Finish your in-class assignment, if neccessary
  * Decide what API(s) you want to use for your final project. Play around with a few that interest you and try to access them via a Fetch call
  * *For Thursday, November 18*: Prepare a presesntation for your Final Project idea. Your presentation should be shareable as a PDF and include a moodboard, site map, and wireframes. The final assignment is similar to the midterm in that you are expected to have a complete idea and a reason for why you want to make this. You are responsible for making a web application that is thoughtfully designed and built for a responsive experience and utitlizes at least one API to populate data or introduce a service to your app. This API can be from a content management system (CMS) powering a personal portfolio. You are allowed to continue work on your midterm project (but I expect to see a significant update) or pivot to a new idea.
