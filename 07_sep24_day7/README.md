### Homework

* Do a Learning Log on Flexbox by Thursday!

* Upload your in-class assignment to NYU classes

* Finish creating the HTML and CSS for your Craigslist Homepage. Try to take advantage of Flexbox.

* Prepare your midterm presentation. You will be creating a fully functioning website, styled with CSS. It is up to you if it is multiple pages or just one HTML page, but every design element must be well considered. Next Thursday (October 1st), you will be presenting your midterm ideas and getting critique. Your presentation must include:
    * A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is not enough of a reason.
    * A wirefame of your home page
    * A mood board of images, inspirations, color palette, etc. that demonstrate the look and feel
    * A basic sitemap
    * REMEMBER: Your midterms are due October 13th and will be presented in class on October 13th and October 15th
