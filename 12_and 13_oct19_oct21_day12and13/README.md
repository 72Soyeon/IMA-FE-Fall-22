**Midterm Presentation Week!**

*** Reminder- Duorfan & Mingren have Learning Log Presentations next week

**Homework**

  *** Due Tuesday, October 26 ***
    * Complete a [midterm self-assessment](../midtermselfassessment.md) and upload it to Brightspace.

    * Read and interact with this essay, [What is Code](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). It's interactive- have fun playing with it! **I recomended you read this on desktop or tablet**
    
    * Write a short response to the essay (at least 150 words) and upload to Brightspace. Some things to think about- What's something you learned? Do you disagree with Paul Ford in any way? As undergraduate students, you are not the audience for this piece; did it still resonate with you? What assumptions is the author making about people who write code? What did you think of the user experience of reading the essay? Check out the [Github page](https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode) for the website, in particular the [Issues panel](https://github.com/BloombergMedia/whatiscode/issues). Would you raise any issues, technical or editorial?
