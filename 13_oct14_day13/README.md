In lieu of class, take our 90 minutes of time together and read and interact with this essay, [What is Code](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/). It's interactive- have fun playing with it! **I recomended you read this on desktop**

**Homework**

* Write a short response to the essay (at least 150 words) and upload to Brightspace. Some things to think about- What's something you learned? Do you disagree with Paul Ford in any way? As undergraduate students, you are not the audience for this piece; did it still resonate with you? What assumptions is the author making about people who write code? What did you think of the user experience of reading the essay? 

* Complete a [midterm self-assessment](../midtermselfassessment.md) and upload it to Brightspace.

* Complete any remaining work needed based on the feedback you received in class and upload a FINAL version of your site for grading to Brightspace.
