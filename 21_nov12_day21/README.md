## In class Exercise

Work with a partner in a breakout room to do the following:

  * Sign up for a [NYT API Key](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) (make sure both of you do this)
  * Pick a [NYT API](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) you'd like to work with
  * Decide what you want to search for in this API. Give your page a heading and a description of the data being displayed.
  * Use Fetch to get data that populates your html
  * Give that HTML some CSS
  * Make sure you both leave class with a copy of your code. If you didn't finish, complete the assignment for homework (feel free to finish it on your own or continue to work together).
  * Each of you should upload to NYU classes via a Github link.

## Homework
  * Finish your in-class assignment, if neccessary
  * Decide what API(s) you want to use for your final project. Play around with a few that interest you and try to access them via a Fetch call
