### Homework

* Do a Learning Log on Flexbox by Thursday!

* Prepare your midterm presentation! You will be creating a fully functioning website, styled with CSS. It is up to you if it is multiple pages or just one HTML page, but every design element must be well considered. On Tuesday and Thursday next week, you will be presenting your midterm ideas and getting critique. Your presentation must include:

* A concise elevator pitch: What are you making? Why? Your content should be well considered. You should be able to articulate the need for the website you will be creating. "It looks cool" is not enough of a reason.

* A wirefame of your home page

* A mood board of images, inspirations, color palette, etc. that demonstrate the look and feel

* A basic sitemap

* REMEMBER: Your midterms are due March 10th and will be presented in class on March 10th and March 12th
