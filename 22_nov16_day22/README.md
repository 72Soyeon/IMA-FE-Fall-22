## Homework

For Thursday: Be prepared to a presesntation for your Final Project idea. Your presentation should be shareable as a PDF and include a moodboard, site map, and wireframes. The final assignment is similar to the midterm in that you are expected to have a complete idea and a reason for why you want to make this. You are responsible for making a web application that is thoughtfully designed and built for a responsive experience and utitlizes at least one API to populate data or introduce a service to your app. This API can be from a content management system (CMS) powering a personal portfolio. You are allowed to continue work on your midterm project (but I expect to see a significant update) or pivot to a new idea.
